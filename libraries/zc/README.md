# ZC Library

## Overview

The `zc` library is a selectively ported and adapted version of the `zc` library from
the [Cap'n Proto project](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto.git). The original `zc` library, located in the
`c++/src/zc` directory, has been partially ported to fit the specific needs of my project. This library retains the core
functionalities while making necessary adaptations for better integration with my project.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude and admiration to the `zc` library team for their exceptional work. The
`zc` library is a testament to their expertise and dedication, and it has had a significant impact on the C++ community.
Their contributions have provided a solid foundation upon which this project is built.
